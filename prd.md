Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Language Switcher with Translated Text (Astro Implementation)

1. Overview and Background

Our website content is primarily in Korean. To accommodate a global audience, we plan to integrate a dynamic language-switching feature based on user geo-location. Additionally, a toggle switch will allow users to manually swap between languages at any time. We will leverage Astro—a modern web framework known for its fast performance and optimized build process—to implement this functionality.

2. Objectives and Goals
	1.	Automatic Language Detection
	•	Present the site in English or Korean based on the user’s geo-location.
	2.	Manual Language Toggle
	•	Provide a clear toggle to manually switch languages.
	3.	Accurate Translations
	•	Ensure translated content is consistently high-quality.
	4.	Optimized Performance with Astro
	•	Take advantage of Astro’s fast build and rendering approach to ensure minimal overhead.

3. Scope

3.1 In Scope
	•	Two core languages: Korean (existing content) and English (translated content).
	•	Automatic detection of a user’s geo-location (via IP-based or browser locale).
	•	Manual toggle switch on all pages for language switching.
	•	Astro-based integration for server-side or client-side rendering and route management.
	•	Persistent user preferences (cookies or localStorage).

3.2 Out of Scope
	•	Additional languages beyond Korean and English (future phases).
	•	Content translation management (beyond loading existing translations).
	•	Advanced user profiling or tracking that goes beyond storing language preferences.

4. Functional Requirements
	1.	Geo-Location Based Detection
	•	Use IP-based geo-location or browser locale detection.
	•	Default to English for users in the USA, Korean for users in South Korea.
	•	Provide a fallback (English or a default landing) for users outside these regions.
	2.	Language Toggle (UI/UX)
	•	A toggle switch visible on every page (e.g., header or nav bar).
	•	Switching language triggers an instant update of the text (no full refresh if possible).
	3.	Translation Storage and Management
	•	Use separate JSON or data files for each language (e.g., en.json, ko.json).
	•	Ensure easy maintenance and updates for translated content.
	4.	Preference Persistence
	•	Store selected language in localStorage or cookies, so returning visitors see their preferred language.
	5.	Astro Integration
	•	Ensure Astro’s partial SSR or static rendering approach is compatible with dynamic language loading.
	•	Make use of Astro’s file-based routing if needed for localized routes (e.g., /en/…, /ko/…) or a single route with dynamic content.
	•	If server-side detection is used, incorporate it in Astro’s serverless or SSR deployment environment.
	6.	Performance
	•	Minimal overhead from language detection or dynamic loading.
	•	Use Astro’s optimized build for static assets to keep site speed high.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
	1.	Security
	•	Geo-location detection must not store or expose sensitive data.
	2.	Scalability
	•	Able to add more languages without extensive refactoring.
	3.	Reliability
	•	Fallback logic for instances where IP-based detection fails (e.g., VPNs, proxies).
	4.	Maintainability
	•	Translation files are clearly structured, making them simple to update.
	5.	Compliance
	•	Adhere to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) when storing user preferences.

6. User Stories
	1.	Automatic Detection
	•	As a user in the USA, I want the site in English by default so I can read the content immediately.
	•	As a user in South Korea, I want the site in Korean by default so I don’t need to toggle manually.
	2.	Manual Toggle
	•	As a user, I want to switch between English and Korean at will, so I can view content in my preferred language.
	•	As a returning user, I want the site to remember my language preference, so I don’t need to reset it every time.

7. Technical Approach (Astro-Focused)
	1.	Geo-Location Detection
	•	Integrate a third-party IP-based service (e.g., MaxMind, ipapi) or read the user’s browser locale.
	•	Implement initial detection on the server (where possible) if using Astro’s SSR or an Edge function.
	•	If fully static, implement detection client-side to set language after page load.
	2.	Language Files
	•	Store translations in src/translations/en.json and src/translations/ko.json.
	•	Use an Astro component or utility function to load the correct JSON based on the user’s selected language.
	3.	Dynamic Rendering
	•	Option A (Client-Side Switch): Render a base template and inject translated strings via client-side logic.
	•	Option B (Server-Side with Astro SSR): Detect language preference on the server and serve the correct version.
	4.	Toggle Implementation
	•	A small toggle in the header (e.g., a simple toggle button or dropdown).
	•	On toggle, store the user’s preference in localStorage (or cookies) to persist across sessions.
	•	Re-render or reload the relevant text components using Astro’s reactivity (or a small client-side script if needed).
	5.	Build/Deployment
	•	During the Astro build, ensure that translations are bundled correctly.
	•	For SSR, configure the environment (e.g., Node, serverless) to access geo-location data.
	•	For a static site, rely on a client-side approach with fallback or partial SSR.
	6.	Testing Strategy
	•	Unit Tests: Verify that the correct JSON files load based on the preference.
	•	Integration Tests: Confirm that toggling the language updates content across pages.
	•	Geo-Location Mock Tests: Simulate different user IPs or locales.

8. Dependencies and Risks
	•	Dependencies
	•	Astro web framework
	•	Geo-location service (e.g., MaxMind, ipapi)
	•	Browser APIs (for localStorage, navigator.language, etc.)
	•	Risks
	•	VPN or proxy usage may produce inaccurate geo-location results.
	•	Potential confusion if automatic language overrides user preference (must ensure user preference takes precedence once toggled).
	•	Additional complexity in maintaining multiple sets of translations.

9. Acceptance Criteria
	1.	Default Language by Geo-Location:
	•	USA → English, South Korea → Korean, fallback → English.
	2.	Toggle Switch:
	•	Clearly visible on every page.
	•	Instantly switches content to the other language.
	3.	Persistence:
	•	User’s language preference is saved; on revisit, the previously chosen language loads automatically.
	4.	Astro Compatibility:
	•	No significant performance degradation from dynamic content handling.
	•	Correct bundling of translation files.
	5.	Translation Accuracy:
	•	All key pages and UI elements display correct translations in both languages.

10. Metrics and Analytics
	•	Geo-Location vs. Actual Usage:
	•	Compare how many visitors come from certain regions and the default language they receive.
	•	Toggle Interaction Rate:
	•	Measure how often users manually switch languages.
	•	Session Duration/Bounce Rate:
	•	Monitor changes in user engagement after enabling language selection.
	•	User Feedback:
	•	Track direct feedback or support inquiries related to language issues.
